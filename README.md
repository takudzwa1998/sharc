# UCT SHARC Buoy: Data Management Back End

## Repo

This repo is a web-based management tool designed to handle the data logged by the buoys deployed in the MIZ

## File Structure

BE_buoy_models - This is where the database definitions for the respective buoys are located.

BE_routes - All API files are located in here, along with the extracted files.

out - Code Documentation (only in HTML, cannot be interpreted in Github).

src - Front-end code and test code.

server.js - server file.

## Problem Statement

This research project is centered around managing the processed data from the deployed buoys in the Antarctic MIZ and designing a web-based data management and display tool for the SHARC Buoy System. The data management system must display the data in a user friendly, interactive, and informative manner. The system also must be stratified across three sets of users which are public, researchers and administrators. Additionally, the web tool must add more buoys to the system to handle the new processed data from the deployed buoys.
