## UCT SHARC Buoy: Data Management Back End

### Problem Statement

This research project is centered around managing the processed data from the deployed buoys in the Antarctic MIZ and designing a web-based data management and display tool for the SHARC Buoy System. The data management system must display the data in a user friendly, interactive, and informative manner. The system also must be stratified across three sets of users which are public, researchers and administrators. Additionally, the web tool must add more buoys to the system to handle the new processed data from the deployed buoys.

### Project Description

The distribution of sea ice in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in the Southern Ocean (SO) has a significant effect on global climate patterns, but our understanding of this unique region suffers from a lack of Antarctic seasonal in situ measurement data, especially over the winter season. 

A variety of interacting forces, including local weather and wave conditions, strongly affect the formation and development of sea ice in the MIZ. To better characterize sea ice development under the influence of wave dynamics and turbulent environmental conditions, in situ measurements and observations are needed.

The Department of Electrical Engineering (UCT), the Department of Oceanography (UCT) and the South African Weather Service have developed a prototype ice-tethered instrument which can be deployed on ice floes the MIZ of the Southern Ocean1. The prototype sensor buoy was specifically designed for the Antarctic region, to operate remotely under extreme environmental conditions and provide real-time local data through an Iridium satellite link.

Each unit was designed with Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors for positional data, inertial measurement units (IMU) for wave characteristic collection (wave height, wave period and power spectrum) and environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and wind direction). 

Three basic units (GPS and temperature only) were deployed during the 2019SCALE Winter SA Agulhas II scientific cruise from the SA Agulhas II to investigate survivability under real-world conditions. From these tests, improvements to the design have been made and several key areas for further improvement of the platform have been identified.
